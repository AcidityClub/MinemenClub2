# Minemen Club - Commands
The Minemen Club server has various staff commands from several plugins. This markdown file will go into them *with detail*.

## Command Map
The information here is probably not 100% accurate!

### XeNitrogen (Handles generalized tasks, ex: punishments/punishment lookups, filtered messages, ...)
- /cd <player>: Check to see if a player is disguised, and if so, display their actual username.

- /c <player>: Check command, displays a "inventory user interface" that shows a target player's punishment history.

- /cf: Displays chat-filter information.

- /clearchat: Clears the global chat using mainly empty characters.

- /mutechat: Mutes the global chat for non-staff players.

- /slowchat <duration (seconds)>: Slows the global chat for non-staff members.

- /tempmute <player> <duration> <reason>: Temporarily mutes a player.

- /mute <player> <reason>: Permanently mutes a player.

- /tfm: Toggles visibility for filtered messages. Command `/cf` displays an index for the chat filter, which filters out bad or inappropriate messages.

- /unmutechat: Un-mutes the chat for everyone.

- /staffhistory [player]: Opens a "inventory user interface" that shows statistics for staff members. This includes how much total/active punishments have been given out, and similiar statistics.

- /ban <player> <reason>: Permanently bans a player.

- /tempban <player> <duration> <reason>: Temporarily bans a player.

- /tp <player>: Teleports you to a player.

- /profile <player>: Views some sort of profile for a target player. (Not sure what this looks like or what it displays exactly.)

- /tphere <player> Teleports a player to you.

- /alts <player>: Displays a list of alternative accounts for a player (using ip-address information).

- /resetstats <player>: Resets practice statistics for a player. **This may be in the Practice plugin, but not entirely sure...**

### Practice (Handles practice related tasks)
- /fol <player>: Makes you automatically spectate a player in practice. Mainly used by staff, but normal players can now use it.

- /matchhistory <player>: Opens a "inventory user interface" that shows ranked match history for players. Mainly used by staff, but players with PRO or higher can use this now.

- /tournamentadmin <id> <kit> <team slot> <count>: Creates a tournament for practice.

### XeBasic/Basic
- /disguise (CONFIRMED!): Disguises you in such a way to hide your real username and skin. Disguise is 100% in the XeBasic/Basic plugin.

- /onlinedisguises: Staff command that shows you all disguised players that are currently online.

### ClubModUtilities (Handles staff chat and other staff exclusive features)
- /jtp <player>: Teleports you to a player, even across different server instances.

- /tsm: Toggles staff messages. Staff messages include staff joins, "jump tos", chats, etc.

- /staffchat: Toggles staff chat, I assume you have to have staff messages enabled first, but not entirely sure.

- /adminchat: Toggles admin chat.

- /onlinestaff: Displays all online staff members.

- /onlinemedia (???): Displays all online media-ranked players. (No idea what purpose this was made for, to be honest.)

### Unknown
- idk: Placeholder, just for the laughs until we find new uncategorized commands.
